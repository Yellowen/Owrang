Print Formats are the layouts that are generated when you want to Print or Email a transaction like a Sales Invoice. There are two types of Print Formats,

- The auto-generated “Standard” Print Format: This type of format follows the same layout as the form and is generated automatically by Owrang.
- Based on the Print Format document. There are templates in HTML that will be rendered with data.

Owrang comes with a number of pre-defined templates in three styles: Modern, Classic and Spartan. You modify these templates or create your own. Editing Owrang templates is not allowed because they may be over-written in an upcoming release.

To create your own versions, open an existing template from:

> Setup > Printing > Print Formats

Select the type of Print Format you want to edit and click on the “Copy” button on the right column. A new Print Format will open up with “Is Standard” set as “No” and you can edit the Print Format.

Editing a Print Format is a long discussion and you will have to know a bit of HTML, Javascript and Python to learn this. For help, please post on our forum.

> Note: Pre-printed stationary is usually not a good idea because your Prints will look incomplete (inconsistent) when you send them by mail.

#### Footers

Many times you may want to have a standard footer for your prints with your address and contact information. Unfortunately due to the limited print support in HTML pages, it is not possible unless you get it scripted. Either you can use pre-printed stationary or add this information in your header.

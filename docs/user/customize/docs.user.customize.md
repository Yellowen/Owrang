Owrang offers many tools to customize the system.

You simplify the forms by hiding features you donâ€™t need using Disable Features and Module Setup, add Custom Fields, change form properties, like adding more options to drop-downs or hiding fields using Customize Form View and make your own Print Formats by using HTML Templates. You can also create multiple Letter Heads for your Prints.

### Hiding Module Icons

To hide modules (icons) from the home page, go to:

Setup > Customize Owrang > Modules Setup

> Note: Modules are automatically hidden for users that have no permissions on the documents within that module. For example, if a user has no permissions on Purchase Order, Purchase Request, Supplier, the “Buying” module will automatically be hidden.

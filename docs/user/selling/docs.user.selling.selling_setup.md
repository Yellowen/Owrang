Completing the selling setup is an important step in Owrang. You need to identify whether you would like to name your customers with their Customer Name or with Serial No. Also, specify whether all the sales transactions have to be accompanied with Sales Order and Delivery Note. Specify your Default Customer Group and the Default Territory you operate in.

Managing Projects

Owrang helps you manage your Projects by breaking them into Tasks and allocating them to different people. 

Purchasing and selling can also be tracked against Projects and this can help the company keep tabs on its budget, delivery and profitability for a Project. 

Projects can be used to manage internal projects, manufacturing jobs or service jobs. For service jobs, Time Sheets can also be created that can be used to bill Customers if billing is done on a Time & Money basis.

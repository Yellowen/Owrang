#### How to Attach files?

When you open a form, on the right sidebar, you will see a section to attach files. Click on “Add” and select the file you want to attach. Click on “Upload” and you are set.

#### What is a CSV file?

A CSV (Comma Separated Value) file is a data file that you can upload into Owrang to update various data. Any spreadsheet file from popular spreadsheet applications like MS Excel or Open Office Spreadsheet can be saved as a CSV file.

If you are using Microsoft Excel and using non-English characters, make sure to save your file encoded as UTF-8. For older versions of Excel, there is no clear way of saving as UTF-8. So save your file as a CSV, then open it in Notepad, and save as “UTF-8”. (Sorry blame Microsoft for this!)

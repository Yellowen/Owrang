In Owrang, you can manage Employee Appraisals by creating an Appraisal Template for each role with the parameters that define the performance by giving appropriate weightage to each parameter.

> HR > Appraisal > New Appraisal



#### Step 1: Select an Appraisal Template

Once the Appraisal Template is completed, you can create Appraisal records for each period where you track performance. You can give points out of 5 for each parameter and the system will calculate the overall performance of the Employee.

To make the Appraisal final, make sure to “Submit” it.

Employee records also help in keeping a list of your team’s skills, previous employment history and  emergency information.

### Numbering Employees (Employee ID)

By default, in Owrang Employee Records are Numbered. You can have multiple series if you are a really large company and want to have separate numbering series for separate locations etc. You can set the numbering series just like any other transaction by going to:

> Setup > Customize  > Document Numbering Series.

Alternatively, you can create employees by the “Employee Number” field if you already have an existing Employee Numbering system you want to follow. To set this, go to

> Setup > Global Defaults > HR

and update the “Employee Records created by” field.

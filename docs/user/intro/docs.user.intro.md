## What is an ERP and why should I care?

(If you are already convinced you need an all-in-one system for your organization, you can skip this page.)

If you are running a small business that has a few employees, you understand that it's hard to manage the dynamic nature of doing businesses. You are already using a software like Accounting, and may be some more to manage your inventory and sales (or CRM). 

An ERP brings all of this together in one place.

Small businesses are not so different from large ones. They contain most of the complexities of a large business along with many other constraints. Small businesses have to communicate with customers, do accounts, pay taxes, do payroll, manage timelines, deliver quality, answer questions, and keep everyone happy just like in large businesses.

Large businesses have the advantage of using advanced data systems to manage their process efficiently. Small businesses, on the other hand, typically struggle to keep things organized. They often use a mix of apps like spreadsheets, accounting software, web CRM etc to manage.The problem is, not everyone is on the same page. An ERP changes that.

A Price List is a place where different rate plans can be stored. Itâ€™s a name you give to a set of Item Prices stored under a particular Price List.

An Item can have multiple prices based on customer, currency, region, shipping cost etc, which can be stored as different rate plans. In Owrang, you are required to store all the lists seperately. Buying Price List is different from Selling Price List and thus is stored separately.

> For multiple currencies, maintain multiple Price Lists.


To add a new Item to the Price List, add the Item Code and its rate in the Item Prices table.

You can also import Item Prices via [Data Import Tool](docs.user.setup.data_import.html)

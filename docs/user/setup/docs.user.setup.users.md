#### Step 4: Security Settings

- Enabling / disabling users: You can enable or disable users. Disabled users will not be able to log in.
- Setting login time: If login time is set, users can only log-in within the defined hours as per your timezone.

If you wish to give the user access to the system only between office hours, or during weekends, mention it under security settings.
